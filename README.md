- 👋 Hi, I’m @neldroid
- 👀 I’m interested in create things. And this could be anything... I tried with blacksmithing, woodworking. Now I'm trying to create things in 3D, but also
- create Android projects, learn Kotlin, build video games or Metaverse experiencies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, Blender, Unity... And some draw techniques
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and webinars
- 📫 How to reach me: Email nahuelul@gmail.com
